	abstract = {Objectives To report on the causes of blindness certifications in England and Wales in working age adults (16–64 years) in 2009–2010; and to compare these with figures from 1999 to 2000.
Design Analysis of the national database of blindness certificates of vision impairment (CVIs) received by the Certifications Office.
Setting and participants Working age (16–64 years) population of England and Wales.
Main outcome measures Number and cause of blindness certifications.
Results The Certifications Office received 1756 CVIs for blindness from persons aged between 16 and 64 inclusive between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. The main causes of blindness certifications were hereditary retinal disorders (354 certifications comprising 20.2\% of the total), diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (253 persons, 14.4\%) and optic atrophy (248 persons, 14.1\%). Together, these three leading causes accounted for almost 50\% of all blindness certifications. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, the leading causes of blindness certification were diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (17.7\%), hereditary retinal disorders (15.8\%) and optic atrophy (10.1\%).
Conclusions For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders. This change may be related to factors including the introduction of nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in England and Wales and improved glycaemic control. Inherited retinal disease, now representing the commonest cause of certification in the working age population, has clinical and research implications, including with respect to the provision of care/resources in the NHS and the allocation of research funding.},

	abstract = {AIM: To estimate the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a diabetic population of the public health system.
METHODS: This non-experimental, descriptive and cross-sectional study, with no direct control over the variables analysed, was carried out by the Telemedicine Unit of the University of Concepción (TELMED) and the Family Health Centers (CESFAM) of the Health Service Concepción, Chile, among a population of 7382 diabetic patients of the public health system, from October 2014 to June 2015. Two digital images for each patient's eyes were obtained and uploaded to the TELMED tele-ophthalmology platform. The images were remotely evaluated by a retina expert ophthalmologist for diagnosis. Treatment and a referral (if required) were recommended, and an individualised report for each patient was sent to the place of origin.
RESULTS: The prevalence of DR in this study was 14.9\%. Of these, 48.7\% had mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), 30.8\% moderate NPDR, 15.9\% severe NPDR, and 4.6\% proliferative DR. Of the patients with DR, 17.8\% were referred for fluorescein angiography, 4.3\% for panretinal photocoagulation, 1.2\% for vitrectomy, and 0.4\% for cataract surgery.
CONCLUSION: The use of telemedicine allowed an increased screening coverage for DR in diabetic patients. The different types of DR were detected in a timely manner, decreasing waiting times due to the lack of specialists in ophthalmology in the public health system.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 2002, Diabetic Retinopathy was reported as the leading cause of blindness in the working age group. The introduction of systematic screening programs in the UK has reduced visual loss and blindness due to diabetic retinopathy, but it does still occur with catastrophic consequences for the individual.
AREAS COVERED: The author conducted an ongoing search for articles relating to diabetic retinopathy since 2000 utilizing Zetoc Alert with keywords and contents page lists from relevant journals. This review covers the risk factors for loss of vision due to diabetic retinopathy and discusses ways in which the awareness of these risk factors can be used to further reduce visual loss. Some risk factors such as glycemic and B/P control are well known from landmark trials. This review has included these factors but concentrated more on the evidence behind those risk factors that are not so clearly defined or so well known.
EXPERT OPINION: The major risk factors are well known, but one continues to find that people with diabetes lose vision in situations in which a better awareness of the risks by both the individual with diabetes and the health workers involved may have prevented the visual loss.},

RESULTS: The Certifications Office received 1756 CVIs for blindness from persons aged between 16 and 64 inclusive between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. The main causes of blindness certifications were hereditary retinal disorders (354 certifications comprising 20.2\% of the total), diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (253 persons, 14.4\%) and optic atrophy (248 persons, 14.1\%). Together, these three leading causes accounted for almost 50\% of all blindness certifications. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, the leading causes of blindness certification were diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (17.7\%), hereditary retinal disorders (15.8\%) and optic atrophy (10.1\%).
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders. This change may be related to factors including the introduction of nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in England and Wales and improved glycaemic control. Inherited retinal disease, now representing the commonest cause of certification in the working age population, has clinical and research implications, including with respect to the provision of care/resources in the NHS and the allocation of research funding.},

	volume = {43},
	issn = {1552-5783},
	abstract = {Purpose: A screening program for diabetic eye disease was established in Iceland 25 years ago. We study the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and evaluate visual acuity in the diabetic population involved in the screening program. Methods: We reviewed charts of all diabetic patients in the university eye clinic, a total of 1433 patients. 368 patients had type 1 diabetes (using insulin and age at onset \&lt;30 years), 213 (58\%) males and 155 (42\%) females. The median age of diagnosis was 16 (1-29) years and average duration of diabetes 20 (1-55) years. A total of 1065 patients had type 2 diabetes, 656 (62\%) males and 459 (38\%) females. The median age of diagnosis was 54 (30-84) years and average duration of diabetes 12 (1-40) years. Results: In the type 1 group, 49\% had any DR and 13\% proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and 3\% history of diabetic macular edema (DME). In patients with less than 20 years of diabetes, 32\% had any DR , 4\% PDR and 3\% history of DME. In patients with duration of 20 years or more, 75\% had any DR, 26\% PDR and 4\% history of DME. 81\% had visual acuity 6/6 or better, 1\% legally blind (\&lt;6/60) and 2\% partially sighted (\&lt;6/18, ≷6/60 ). In the type 2 group, 42\% had any DR, 4\% PDR and 7\% history of DME. In patients with duration less than 20 years, 40\% had any DR, 3\% PDR and 6\% history of DME. In patients with duration of 20 years or more, 59\% had any DR, 7\% PDR and 12\% history of DME. 59\% had 6/6 or better, 1\% legally blind and 3\% partially sighted. Conclusion: Diabetics who participate in regular screening program in Iceland have a low prevalence of blindness and partial sight. The current prevalence of retinopathy and blindness is similar to that seen in 1994, whereas blindness is much lower now than in 1980. This suggests that legal blindness rates have levelled out at about 1\% and partial sight at about 3\% in diabetics in regular screening programs.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
          Diabetic retinopathy is the most common specific complication of diabetes mellitus. Traditional care for patients with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy is fragmented, uncoordinated and delivered in a piecemeal nature, often in the most expensive and high-resource tertiary settings. Transformative new models incorporating digital technology are needed to address these gaps in clinical care.
          Recent findings 
          Artificial intelligence and telehealth may improve access, financial sustainability and coverage of diabetic retinopathy screening programs. They enable risk stratifying patients based on individual risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy including diabetic macular edema (DME), and predicting which patients with DME best respond to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
          Summary 
          Progress in artificial intelligence and tele-ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in ‘real-world settings’ and cost-effectiveness studies are summarized. Furthermore, the initial research on the use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification and management of DME are outlined along with potential future directions. Finally, the need for artificial intelligence adoption within ophthalmology in response to coronavirus disease 2019 is discussed. Digital health solutions such as artificial intelligence and telehealth can facilitate the integration of community, primary and specialist eye care services, optimize the flow of patients within healthcare networks, and improve the efficiency of diabetic retinopathy management.},

We evaluated vision-related quality of life in patients with visual acuity {\textless}5/10 in the better eye induced by retinopathy using the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The NEI VFQ-25 was self-administered to 196 patients in 3 Italian centres (A, B and C; n = 64, 61 and 71, respectively) dedicated to DR screening and treatment. Patients in the 3 centres did not differ by age, gender, occupation and diabetes duration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that reduced visual acuity was associated with decreased scores for General Vision, Near Activities, Distance Activities, Visual-Specific Social Functioning, Mental Health, Role Difficulties and Dependency, Driving, Colour Vision and Peripheral Vision (p {\textless} 0.01, all). Treatment by photocoagulation was associated with reduced scores in General Health (−8.3; p = 0.002), General Vision (−7.2; p = 0.001), Visual-Specific Role Difficulties (−8.8; p = 0.015) and Driving (−13.7; p = 0.003). Centre affiliation was associated with different scores for General Health, Ocular pain, Distance Activities, Visual-Specific Social Functioning and Role Difficulties and Peripheral Vision. Women had higher scores for General Vision (p = 0.015), Near Activities (p = 0.005), Distance Activities (p = 0.006), Visual-Specific Social Functioning (p = 0.03), Visual-Specific Mental Health (p = 0.035) and Colour Vision (p = 0.012). Diabetic retinopathy and vision loss modify the way people perceive their own ability to function autonomously. More data should be collected to confirm this interpretation and to guide the development of more appropriate settings to improve approach and support to patients.},

               negative impact on developing countries. A number of new
               initiatives address this imbalance, ranging from consortial
               licensing and new publishing models to the Open Access
               Initiative, and have the ability to meet the needs of research
               in financially constrained countries. The advent of the Open
               Access strategies, particularly interoperable institutional
               archives, has the potential to revolutionize access to essential

	abstract = {People with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are likely to experience enhanced social and emotional strain. Critically, those with both vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and psychosocial problems may have significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with psychologically healthy counterparts. This can cause inadequate compliance, increased strain on family functioning, worse diabetes control, increased progression of diabetic retinopathy and, consequently, further psychosocial stress resulting in a number of concerning implications for disease management, clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. However, the emotional and social health consequences of diabetic retinopathy have not yet been systematically explored. This information is crucial as it allows for a targeted approach to treatment and prevention and avoidance of the potentially detrimental implications described above. Therefore, this paper reviews the current qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and identifies directions for future research. Key search terms were applied to the electronic databases Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and Embase and the bibliographies of relevant papers were systematically reviewed for additional references. Overall, the evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy and associated vision loss have several debilitating effects, including disruption of family functioning, relationships and roles; increased social isolation and dependence; and deterioration of work prospects resulting in increased financial strain. Adverse emotional responses include fear, anxiety, vulnerability, guilt, loss of confidence, anger, stress and self-perception issues. However, the research to date is largely qualitative in nature, with most quantitative studies being small, cross-sectional and somewhat outdated. Similarly, the outcome measures used in many studies to date are suboptimal in terms of content and validity. Therefore, this review identifies the need for improved outcome measures to provide valid, meaningful measurement of the social and emotional impact of diabetic retinopathy and discusses potential directions for future research such as item banking and computer adaptive testing.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To synthesize the evidence on the impact of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema from the patient perspective.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, EMBASE and AMED. We included articles investigating the impact of the condition on quality of life, symptoms, visual functioning, activities of daily living, well-being, social functioning, and financial status. The studies evaluated were observational, including cross-sectional, prospective cohort and retrospective cohort designs. Outcome data were extracted and synthesized.
RESULTS: Searches yielded 5114 publications. After screening, 85 studies were included, measuring the following outcomes: visual functioning (n=46); quality of life (n=22); well-being (n=16); functional status (n=5); work (n=4); and visual task performance (n=2). Diabetic retinopathy has a considerable impact on visual functioning and this is greater in people with greater disease severity. Diabetic retinopathy significantly limits activities including working, driving, walking and reading, and has the potential to have a negative impact on psychological well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic retinopathy is associated with poor self-reported visual functioning, well-being, and health-related quality of life. Ability to perform basic everyday tasks appears to diminish with disease severity. Some studies suggest impaired mobility and problems with work, but there are gaps in this evidence.},

	abstract = {To examine the global prevalence and major risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes.A pooled analysis using individual participant data from population-based studies around the world was performed. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all population-based studies in general populations or individuals with diabetes who had ascertained DR from retinal photographs. Studies provided data for DR end points, including any DR, proliferative DR, diabetic macular edema, and VTDR, and also major systemic risk factors. Pooled prevalence estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2010 World Diabetes Population aged 20–79 years.A total of 35 studies (1980–2008) provided data from 22,896 individuals with diabetes. The overall prevalence was 34.6\% (95\% CI 34.5–34.8) for any DR, 6.96\% (6.87–7.04) for proliferative DR, 6.81\% (6.74–6.89) for diabetic macular edema, and 10.2\% (10.1–10.3) for VTDR. All DR prevalence end points increased with diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, and blood pressure levels and were higher in people with type 1 compared with type 2 diabetes.There are approximately 93 million people with DR, 17 million with proliferative DR, 21 million with diabetic macular edema, and 28 million with VTDR worldwide. Longer diabetes duration and poorer glycemic and blood pressure control are strongly associated with DR. These data highlight the substantial worldwide public health burden of DR and the importance of modifiable risk factors in its occurrence. This study is limited by data pooled from studies at different time points, with different methodologies and population characteristics.},

Latent variable mixture modeling is an emerging statistical approach that models such heterogeneity by classifying individuals into unobserved groupings (latent classes) with similar (more homogenous) patterns. The purpose of the second of a 2-article set is to offer a nontechnical introduction to longitudinal latent variable mixture modeling. Methods 3 latent variable approaches to modeling longitudinal data are reviewed and distinguished. Results Step-by-step pediatric psychology examples of latent growth curve modeling, latent class growth analysis, and growth mixture modeling are provided using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 data file. Conclusions Latent variable mixture modeling is a technique that is useful to pediatric psychologists who wish to find groupings of individuals who share similar longitudinal data patterns to determine the extent to which these patterns may relate to variables of interest.},
